# leetcode problems practice

My solutions to problems available on leetcode.

All solutions passed on the website

I give myself the time limits below. 
If I have a working solution after those limits I usually stop unless I believe futher
work to be of benefit.
 
I also stop if I believe my solution to be optimal or if I don't believe further work will
benefit my practice (i.e. not all solutions here are optimal - nor are they supposed to 
represent my best work ;) .
If I do not have a solution I usually keep going until I do.
I spend some time after each problem looking at other solutions. 

- Easy - 15 mins
- Medium - 30 mins
- Hard - 60 mins
